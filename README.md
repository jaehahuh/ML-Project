Program language : Python (jupyter Notebook)

1. Goal

The goal of the project is to divide the dataset into a training set and a test set, and predict housing prices using a supervised machine learning models with given features (column).

2. Data

The dataset has a total of 81 columns, including street, house size, building type, house condition, number of toilets, and other factors used to evaluate the house

3. Machine learning models

Models applied to supervised learning tested a total of three models: MLP Regressor, Ridge Regressor, and XGB Register. After testing normalized and unnormalized data, proceed with a model that can achieve better results.
