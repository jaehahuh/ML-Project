1. Goal

The goal of the project is to divide the dataset into a training set and a test set, and predict housing prices using a supervised machine learning models with given features (column).

2. Data
It has a total of 14 variables and all variables have 303 observations without missing values.

The dataset has a total of 81 columns, including street, house size, building type, house condition, number of toilets, and other factors used to evaluate the house

3. Machine learning models

Models applied to supervised learning tested a total of three models: MLP Regressor, Ridge Regressor, and XGB Register.
